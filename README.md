# EmailSpamFiltering
This is my first Machine Learning Project. This is an attempt to classify emails as spam or ham with 98.77% accuracy using NLTK's Naive Bayes Classifier and Enron Email corpus.

I have used the preprocessed form of the dataset available here: http://www2.aueb.gr/users/ion/data/enron-spam/
